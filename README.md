<h1 align="center"><strong>How to connect a Prisma docker instance to your AWS RDS MySQL database</strong></h1>

<br />

- Project uses [graphcool/prisma](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma), Docker and AWS RDS MySQL.
- The ultimate goal to is create a graphql server with [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga), `prisma` and AWS RDS MySQL.
- In this repo, we are focused on setting up `prisma` so it can talk to our MySQL instance
- Please feel free to make suggested improvements and raise issues.

## Current status

When I run `prisma deploy`, I get the following error:

```
Could not generate token for local cluster example-cluster. error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line
```

## Setting up your AWS MySQL RDS database

Use the following [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/marktani/8631cb9c63d0973bcdd8bff19d6162c2) to setup a MySQL database on AWS RDS's free tier

## Check your MySQL instance is available

Using the local mysql client, connect to your AWS RDS database

```sh
mysql -u {username} -p{password} -h {remote server ip} {DB name}
```

## Configure Docker

- Make sure you have Docker installed
- Save the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file
- Create your `.env` file. You can use [`.env.example`](./.env.example) as a template
- `SQL_INTERNAL_DATABASE` needs to be set to `graphcool`. I think it might be an internal db used by prisma and the name of the db is not related to your db name in AWS

**Note** When creating your `.env` file, do not use double quotes (`"`). Especially on the DB_HOST because they cause a `java.net.UnknownHostException` error.

For those interested, I'm using the following docker repo: [`prismagraphql/prisma`](https://hub.docker.com/r/prismagraphql/prisma/)

## Configure Prisma

Open `~/.prisma/config.yml` and add a new entry (here called example-cluster) to the clusters map:

```
clusters:
  example-cluster:
    host: 'http://localhost:4466'
```

Before applying that definition, we have to generate a public/private-keypair so that the CLI is able to communicate with this Prisma server. Head over to https://api.cloud.prisma.sh/ and execute the following query:

```
{
  generateKeypair {
    public
    private
  }
}
```

Make sure to store those values in a safe place. Now, copy the public key and paste it into your `.env` file under `CLUSTER_PUBLIC_KEY=your-key`.

Copy and paste the private key into `~/.prisma/config.yml` 

```
clusters:
  example-cluster:
    host: 'http://localhost:4466'
    clusterSecret: my-private-key
```

Alternatively you can use the `prisma cluster add` command to manage your `~/.prisma/config.yml` file

## Launch Docker

The following command starts the docker instance using the docker-compose.yml file

```sh
docker-compose up 
```

Check your instance is running
```sh
docker ps
```

Get the logs
```sh
docker logs prisma
```

Your instance playground should now be available at http://localhost:4466/cluster

If you need it you can use the following to take down the instance
```sh
docker-compose down
```

## Deploy your prisma service

Initialize your project using

```
prisma init
```

Deploy your project

```
prisma deploy
```

Select your new private cluster (in this case `example-cluster`)

```
? Please choose the cluster you want to deploy "project-name@dev" to 

  workspace/prisma-eu1            Free development cluster (hosted on Prisma Cloud) 
  workspace/prisma-us1            Free development cluster (hosted on Prisma Cloud) 
‚ùØ example-cluster        Local cluster (requires Docker) 
                       
  You can learn more about deployment in the docs: http://bit.ly/prisma-graphql-deployment
```

**Alternatively you can edit your `.env` file on an exiting project**
In order to deploy to your local prisma cluster from an existing project, you can edit your `.env` file. 

```
PRISMA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4466/<prisma-service>/<stage>
PRISMA_CLUSTER=example-cluster
```
